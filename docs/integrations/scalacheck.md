MUnit supports writing property-based tests using
[ScalaCheck](http://www.scalacheck.org/).

## Getting Started

ScalaCheck support is provided as a separate module. You can add it to your
build via:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalameta" %% "munit-scalacheck" % "@VERSION@" % Test
```

You can then extend `ScalaCheckSuite` and write ScalaCheck property tests:

```scala mdoc
import munit.scalacheck.ScalaCheckSuite
import org.scalacheck.Prop._

class IntegerSuite extends ScalaCheckSuite {

  property("addition is commutative") {
    forAll { (n1: Int, n2: Int) =>
      n1 + n2 == n2 + n1
    }
  }

  property("0 is the identity of addition") {
    forAll { (n: Int) =>
      n + 0 == n
    }
  }

}
```

> ðŸ‘‰ `property` is almost identical to `FunSuite`'s `test`, but it additionally
> ensures that the test value is a ScalaCheck `Prop`.
>
> It supports all of `test`'s features, such as tagging and marking the property
> as expected to fail:
>
> ```scala
> property("my property".tag(WindowsOnly)) {
>   forAll { (n: Int) => n * 0 == 0 }
> }
> ```
>
> ```scala
> property("issue-123".fail) {
>   forAll { (n: Int) => buggyFunction(n) }
> }
> ```

## Configuring ScalaCheck

You can override the `scalaCheckTestParameters` property of `ScalaCheckSuite` to
customize how ScalaCheck checks the properties:

```scala mdoc:reset
import munit.scalacheck.ScalaCheckSuite
import org.scalacheck.Prop._

class IntegerSuite extends ScalaCheckSuite {

  override def scalaCheckTestParameters =
    super.scalaCheckTestParameters
      .withMinSuccessfulTests(200)
      .withMaxDiscardRatio(10)

  property("addition is commutative") {
    forAll { (n1: Int, n2: Int) =>
      n1 + n2 == n2 + n1
    }
  }

}
```

## Migrating from ScalaTest

ScalaTest provides two styles for writing property-based tests, which are both
front-ends to ScalaCheck.

If you are using the "ScalaCheck style" API, i.e. the `Checkers` trait,
switching to MUnit requires very minor and mechanical changes:

```diff
-import org.scalatest.prop.Checkers
-import org.scalatest.FunSuite
+import munit.scalacheck.ScalaCheckSuite
 import org.scalacheck.Prop._

-class IntegerSuite extends FunSuite with Checkers {
+class IntegerSuite extends ScalaCheckSuite {

-  test("addition is commutative") {
+  property("addition is commutative") {
-    check { (n1: Int, n2: Int) =>
+    forAll { (n1: Int, n2: Int) =>
       n1 + n2 == n2 + n1
     }
   }

}
```

If you're using the "ScalaTest style" API, i.e. the
`GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks` trait, switching to MUnit requires a little more
work: MUnit does not provide an API over ScalaCheck like ScalaTest does, so you
will need to use the ScalaCheck API directly.

For example, if you are using ScalaTest matchers, you will need to convert them
to boolean checks:

```diff
-import org.scalatest.Matchers
-import org.scalatest.prop.GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks
-import org.scalatest.FunSuite
+import munit.scalacheck.ScalaCheckSuite
+import org.scalacheck.Prop._

-class IntegerSuite extends FunSuite with GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks with Matchers {
+class IntegerSuite extends ScalaCheckSuite {

-  test("addition and multiplication are commutative") {
+  property("addition and multiplication are commutative") {
     forAll { (n1: Int, n2: Int) =>
     forAll { (n1: Int, n2: Int) =>
-      (n1 + n2) should be (n2 + n1)
-      (n1 * n2) should be (n2 * n1)
+      n1 + n2 == n2 + n1 &&
+      n1 * n2 == n2 * n1
     }
   }

}
```
